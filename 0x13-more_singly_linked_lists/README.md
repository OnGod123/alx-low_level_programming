What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of nodes, each containing a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for dynamic memory management.
This repository provides implementations of fundamental linked list operations:

Insertion: Add a new node to the list.
Deletion: Remove a node from the list.
Traversal: Iterate through the linked list to access elements.
Search: Find a specific value in the linked list.
Update: Modify the value of a node.
