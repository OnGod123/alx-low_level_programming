Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element contains a value and two pointers, one to the previous element and one to the next element. This data structure provides efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements.

Features
Doubly Linked: Each node has a reference to both the previous and the next node, allowing for bidirectional traversal.
Dynamic Sizing: Doubly linked lists can easily grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
Efficient Insertion/Deletion: Insertions and deletions at both ends and in the middle of the list are efficient.
