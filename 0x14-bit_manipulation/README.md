Bitwise Operators README
This README provides a concise overview of bitwise operators and their usage in programming.

What are Bitwise Operators?
Bitwise operators are used in programming to perform operations at the bit level. They manipulate individual bits in binary representation of data.
Types of Bitwise Operators
AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

NOT (~): Flips all the bits in the operand, turning 0s into 1s and 1s into 0s.

Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions.

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions.
