# Function Pointers

Function pointers are a powerful feature in C that allow you to treat functions as data, enabling dynamic and flexible programming. They provide a way to store, pass, and call functions within your code.

## How Function Pointers Work

In C, a function is defined by its name, return type, and parameter types. A function pointer points to the memory address of a function, allowing you to call it indirectly. This is useful for scenarios where you want to choose and execute different functions at runtime.

## Declaring Function Pointers

A function pointer declaration follows the format:

```c
return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_types);
